**Wearit: Mobile App for Your Outfit**

## What is this project?
The project was born out of the team's personal concern regarding our lack of knowledge about fashion and how to style clothes. Additionally, we noticed that Indonesia, as one of the main producers of textiles and clothing, did not fully utilize its potential in the fashion industry. We saw an opportunity to not only educate ourselves but also contribute to the growth of local businesses in the fashion industry. The project's goal is to not only improve our own fashion sense but also help others facing similar problems.
